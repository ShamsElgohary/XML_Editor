# XML-Editor
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is one of the most famous formats for storing and sharing information among different devices. Some text editors such as Sublime Text are able to parse such files and do some basic operations. 
In this project, the GUI (Graphical User Interface) based program is able to parse and visualize an XML file and also perform different operations on the XML file like:
- Detecting Errors
- Fixing the Errors that were detected
- Formating ( or Prettifying )
- Converting the XML to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation )
- Minifying
- Compressing the file

The program can view, edit and save XML files.
In addition, it has the ability to detect many errors in the XML file including missing tag terminator or in correct terminator and fix them.
Another functionality is minifying and prettifying the XML file in which spaces before each tag is either removed to decrease file size or add to restore format respectively. 
Also it has the functionality of compressing the XML file to nearly 50% of its size.
And it has the functionality of converting the XML file to a JSON file.
